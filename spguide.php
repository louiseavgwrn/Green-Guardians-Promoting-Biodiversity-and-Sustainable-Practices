    "Composting" => [
        "description" => "Composting is an excellent way to reduce waste and create nutrient-rich soil. It involves the natural decomposition of organic materials, such as fruit and vegetable scraps, leaves, and grass clippings, into a dark, crumbly substance known as compost. This process helps divert organic waste from landfills, enriching the soil, promoting healthy plant growth, and reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. Composting can be done in a variety of ways, from backyard compost bins to worm composting (vermicomposting) and even large-scale composting facilities. By composting, you contribute to a more sustainable environment and foster a healthier ecosystem.",
        "benefits" => "Diverts organic waste from landfills, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and enriches the soil, supporting healthy plant growth.",
        "tips" => [
            "Start with a compost bin or pile in your backyard.",
            "Add a balanced mix of greens (nitrogen-rich materials like fruit scraps, vegetable peels) and browns (carbon-rich materials like dry leaves, cardboard).",
            "Turn your compost every few weeks to aerate it and speed up decomposition.",
            "Avoid adding meat, dairy, or oily foods to prevent odors and pests.",
            "Keep the compost moist but not soggy; it should feel like a damp sponge.",
            "Consider adding eggshells and coffee grounds to boost calcium and nitrogen levels in the compost."
