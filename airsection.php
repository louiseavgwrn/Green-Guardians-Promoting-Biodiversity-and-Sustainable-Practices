    <h2>Additional Tips for Better Air Quality</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Regular Cleaning</h3>
        <p>Keeping your home clean reduces the buildup of dust, allergens, and other pollutants that compromise air quality. Focus on areas like carpets, upholstery, and curtains that tend to trap dust and allergens.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a vacuum cleaner with a **HEPA filter** to effectively trap fine particles.</li>
            <li>Wash bedding, rugs, and curtains regularly to remove dust mites.</li>
            <li>Clean air vents and ducts to ensure proper airflow and minimize dust buildup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mop hard floors instead of sweeping to prevent stirring up dust particles into the air.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Avoid Chemical Cleaners</h3>
        <p>Conventional cleaning products can release harmful chemicals, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), that degrade indoor air quality and may pose health risks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opt for **natural cleaning alternatives** like vinegar, baking soda, or lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Use products labeled as “non-toxic” and “eco-friendly.”</li>
            <li>Avoid aerosol sprays, as they can linger in the air and contribute to air pollution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>DIY Cleaner Recipe:</strong> Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water for a safe and effective all-purpose cleaner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Control Humidity</h3>
        <p>Maintaining optimal humidity levels (30%–50%) prevents mold growth and dust mites, which thrive in high-humidity environments.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a **dehumidifier** in damp areas like basements or bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Ensure proper ventilation by using exhaust fans in kitchens and bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Fix leaks promptly to prevent excess moisture buildup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Place moisture-absorbing products like silica gel packets or charcoal in enclosed spaces to naturally reduce humidity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Use Air-Purifying Furniture and Materials</h3>
        <p>Some furniture and building materials are designed to absorb pollutants and improve air quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose furniture made from **natural, untreated wood** or low-emission materials.</li>
            <li>Install **VOC-absorbing wall panels or paint** designed to purify indoor air.</li>
            <li>Avoid synthetic materials that off-gas harmful chemicals over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Opt for eco-friendly certifications like Greenguard or FSC when selecting furniture and materials.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Implement a "No-Shoes" Policy</h3>
        <p>Shoes track dirt, pollen, and other outdoor pollutants into your home, affecting indoor air quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a **shoe rack near the entrance** to encourage family and guests to remove their shoes.</li>
            <li>Provide comfortable slippers or indoor footwear as an alternative.</li>
            <li>Regularly clean entry mats to reduce dirt buildup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use washable rugs in high-traffic areas to make cleaning easier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Invest in Air Quality Monitors</h3>
        <p>Air quality monitors provide real-time data on pollutant levels, temperature, and humidity, helping you take timely action to improve indoor air quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a monitor with sensors for **PM2.5, carbon dioxide (CO₂), and VOCs**.</li>
            <li>Place the monitor in frequently used areas like the living room or bedroom.</li>
            <li>Use the data to identify pollution sources and track improvements over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Pair air quality monitors with smart home systems for automated air purification or ventilation adjustments.</p>
